Browser-Couch. 

CouchDB in the browser - persistant, syncing client side storage.

Unsorted notes:
	- There's a quick and dirty node.js proxy server in srv,
	 to get around the crossdomain policies for testing.
	 Obviously it's not designed for production use


 == REQUIRES ==

To run the syncing examples out of couchdb you'll need to install
couchapp [http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp]

 == RUNNING == 

From couchapp directory
> couchapp push http://localhost:5984/browsercouch





TODO:

 -- 
 - Sort out Revisioning

 - Make more intelligent storage class based on B-Tree so we can 
   more easily sync recent changes
