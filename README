Browser-Couch. 

CouchDB in the browser - persistant, syncing client side storage.

Unsorted notes:
	- There's a quick and dirty node.js proxy server in srv,
	 to get around the crossdomain policies for testing.
	 Obviously it's not designed for production use


TODO:
 - Move the html into couchdb, so it's served from the same domain
    - obviates the need for the node.js proxy
    - Look at http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp

 - Get to the root of this couchdb traceback

 -- 
 - Sort out Revisioning

 - Make more intelligent storage class based on B-Tree so we can 
   more easily sync recent changes
